# üì¶ Open Payments Php Snippets


This library provides PHP code snippets demonstrating usage of the [Open Payments Php Library](https://github.com/interledger/open-payments-php). It is intended for use with a  <a href="https://wallet.interledger-test.dev/" target="_blank">Test wallet</a>.

While everyone is welcome to use these examples as a reference, please note that you may need to adapt them to suit your specific application or environment.


---

### Prerequisites

- PHP 8.3
- Sodium extension - needed by [Open Payments Php Library](https://github.com/interledger/open-payments-php) for generating keys
- BCMath extension - needed by [Open Payments Php Library](https://github.com/interledger/open-payments-php) for big numbers comparisons
- An active account on <a href="https://wallet.interledger-test.dev/" target="_blank">Test wallet</a>
- A payment pointer associated with your account
- Payment pointer keys should be generated (refer to [loading the private key](#loading-the-private-key))


### üöÄ Setup


```
composer install
```

Make the Console File Executable:

```
chmod +x bin/console
```



### Loading the private key

When generating the keys for a payment pointer on
<a href="https://wallet.interledger-test.dev/settings/developer-keys" target="_blank">Test wallet Developer Keys section</a>, the
private key will be automatically downloaded to your machine. Copy the base64 enncoded private key to use below.

Ensure you are at the repository root and execute the following command in your terminal:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Open the newly created `.env` file and fill in the following variables:

-   `PRIVATE_KEY` - fill the base 64 encoded private key string copied earlier
-   `KEY_ID` - key id of the private key
-   `WALLET_ADDRESS` - with your wallet address url (The payment pointer url but replace `$` with `https://` )

Now that you have all the necessary components to initialize the authenticated Open Payments client, you're ready to
begin utilizing the php code snippets library.
